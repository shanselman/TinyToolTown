A Chrome extension that syncs two browser-based video players — perfect for watching reaction videos alongside the original show.

Built for watching Katee Sackhoff react to Battlestar Galactica on Patreon while streaming the show on Amazon Prime, but works with any two browser-based video players. It's my first project where I let AI run free and it turned out pretty well. Plus, now I can more easily enjoy my BSG watch-a-longs.
