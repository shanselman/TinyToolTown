This tool aims to offer an alternative to the help viewers that used to be around. This tool renders markdown files (or HTML files) - help chapters - in an elegant editor with rich set of tools to make reading help files as enjoyable as possible. The minimum to enter this browser is one MD file, so that at least some of the features, such as full-text search, work. No vendor lock-in. Another interesting feature could be the export of chapter texts in various formats, such as md, ePub, TeX, RTF, HTML or a stylized static copy of a web page.

This tool does not need any server or backend and it is able to run directly from a web browser. Tool can load a ZIP file or directory from a local disk (with CORS policy disabled or a local web server), the contents of a live repository on GitHub, or artifacts from a GitHub repository. There is extensive documentation with tips and examples of what can be done or extended in this tool. Data editor is planned in future.
