Bank transactions are cryptic e.g. "WHOLEFDS MKT 10847 SEATTLE WA"  and your  categories are really generic. I didn't want to connect my bank to yet another service just to budget. With Tally, you export a CSV, describe your rules in plain English to an AI agent "COSTCO with GAS is fuel, otherwise groceries", and it writes the rules for you. No accounts to link, no cloud, just files on your computer.
