HWInfo-TUI is a terminal plotting tool for visualizing real-time hardware sensor data from HWInfo64, inspired by gping. I built it because I wanted a lightweight, always-visible way to monitor thermals, fan speeds, and other sensors without leaving the terminal.

It features real-time ASCII charts with dual Y-axes for different units, fuzzy sensor matching so you don't need exact names, and rich statistics. Fits perfectly in a multi-pane terminal dashboard alongside tools like btm and gping. Available via pip and WinGet.
