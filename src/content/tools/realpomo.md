RealPomo is a tactile, open-source Pomodoro timer app that helps you focus by letting you set work sprints, track tasks, and take breaks in a simple, satisfying way. It features an intuitive dial interface with subtle sound feedback and runs locally, so you can stay in flow without distractions.  Works best on MacOS, but making it better for Windows too :)
